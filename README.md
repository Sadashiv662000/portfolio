# Portavia-like static replica

This is a minimal static HTML/CSS prototype inspired by the Portavia Framer template.

To preview locally:

Windows (double-click or serve):

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Or run a static server, e.g. with Python:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps:

- Replace placeholder images with your project screenshots.
- Add animations and exact typography assets if you want a closer match.
- I can extract the exact assets and recreate interactions on request.
