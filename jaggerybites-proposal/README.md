Jaggery Bite — Proposal Prototype

What's included
- `index.html` — simple marketing homepage prototype
- `styles.css` — styles for the prototype
- `download-images.ps1` — PowerShell script that scrapes the homepage and downloads images into `assets/`

How to get real images from jaggerybites.in
1. Open PowerShell in this folder and run:

```powershell
./download-images.ps1
```

2. The script will create an `assets` folder and save the first image as `hero.*` and the next three as `product1.*`, `product2.*`, `product3.*`. If some images are not desired, replace them manually.

Notes and next steps
- The prototype is self-contained once images are downloaded. Review `index.html` and tweak copy, colors, or layout.
- If you want, I can:
  - polish the responsive behavior and animations
  - build product listing and cart pages (static or with a headless CMS)
  - create a PDF pitch presentation assembled from this prototype
